| Initialized the base grid:
|   Box length            = 50 Mpc/h
|   n                     = 32
|   dx                    = 1.5625
| Initialized a zoom region:
|   Subbox length         = 12.5 Mpc/h
|   n                     = 32
|   dx                    = 0.390625
|   Zoom factor           = 4
|   Num particles         = 1
|   Low-left corner in parent grid = (11, 11, 11)
|   Low-left corner (h**-1 Mpc)    = 17.1875, 17.1875, 17.1875
|   Total particles       = 32831
| WARNING: Opening a zoom where flagged particles are within 3 pixels of the edge. This is prone to numerical errors.
