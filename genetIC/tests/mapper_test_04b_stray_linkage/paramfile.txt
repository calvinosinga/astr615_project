# Test stray particle system when setting and retrieving particle IDs
#
# With strays on, we are allowed to "zoom" beyond the edge of the
# literal zoom grid, but the particles will be interpolated from the
# low-res grid.
#
# This used to mean that the flagged particles were activated in low-res
# blocks, but now they should be uniquely identified.
#
# The input.txt ids to set are constructed from the same geometry
# as in mapper_test_6, but with an ACTUAL high-res region that
# extends far enough rather than with stray mode.
