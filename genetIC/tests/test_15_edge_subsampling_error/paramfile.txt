zoomgrid 2 8 # whole fine grid is selected so that we go right to the edges

# The situation at this point is that we have populated with zoom particles
# all the way to the edge of the fine grid. The fine grid by construction
# aligns with cells of the coarse grid so all is fine. But now we subsample
# at which point the cells no longer perfectly align. This means we want to
# populate with fine particles beyond the edge of the fine grid.
# This literal edge case caused confusing crashes.
