# Test stray particle system when retrieving particle IDs
#
# With strays on, we are allowed to "zoom" beyond the edge of the
# literal zoom grid, but the particles will be interpolated from the
# low-res grid.
#
# The generated sphere of particles used to have some strange properties,
# but recent changes to the code mean that we now demand it behaves as though
# the zoom grid did extend across the full region required. The comparison
# output is generated using a factor 2 zoomgrid, to guarantee the same
# behaviour in this test.
