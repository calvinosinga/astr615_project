# Test mapping of automatically inserted padding regions around zooms
#
# Note that this paramfile does NOT have autopad - it uses an input mapper (below)
# that DOES have autopad and tests it maps onto sensible cells
#
# The tested cells (input.txt) correspond to one particle from each of the
# different real levels and also one of teach of the padding masses. The
# result should be that the real particles come back out, and the padding
# particles map onto another sensible particle. The reference.txt reflects
# this (although there is some residual question mark over exactly which
# particles the padded particles map onto - TO CHECK.)
