# Seed the field using the default algorithm (parallel Fourier space):
random_seed	8896131

# Specify output directory:
outname test
outdir	 ./

# Pick output format:
outformat gadget3

# Specify the base-level grid, 50 Mpc/h, 128 cells on a side:
base_grid 50.0 128

# Prepare to "zoom" all particles within a sphere radius 6 Mpc/h, centred
# on the coordinate 32.5,32.5,32.5 Mpc/h:
centre 32.5 32.5 32.5
select_sphere 6

# Note that instead of defining the zoom region geometrically in the above way,
# we could also have used id_file (see below) to load particle IDs to
# replace with zoom particles

# Now open the zoom region. Make the zoom grid itself a factor 3
# smaller than the base grid, and have 128 cells on a side (thus
# an equivalent resolution to (3x128)=384 on a side):
zoom_grid 3 128

# ...  modifications could be added here ...

# Initialise the random component, apply modifications, and write the
# resulting initial conditions:
done

# Optionally, write diagnostic output --
# Dark matter power spectrum:
dump_ps 0 # <-- the power spectrum evaluated on the base grid
dump_ps 1 # <-- the power spectrum evaluated on the first zoom region
# Numpy array with the overdensity on a grid:
dump_grid 0 # <-- for the base grid
dump_grid 1 # <-- for the first zoom region
